# Welcome to the Testing Center ðŸ“š
## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name's Elena. 
I manage a college testing center. We provide and proctor standardized tests, placement tests, and most of all, tests for students who use accommodations. We keep a busy schedule of appointments, and to help speed up our workflow I've built this single page scheduling application.

Built using HTML, CSS, JS, React, Redux, and Jest. 

Feel free to play around with the live site <a href='https://hellogonzo.github.io/testing-center-2/' target='_blank' >here</a>.

## Project Status
The app is currently fully funcional on desktop (900px or wider). You can view appointments by week, add and edit appointments, view detailed student info, and edit student information.
